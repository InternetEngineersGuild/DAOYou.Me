# DAOYou

## The Simple Breakdown

The DAOYou.Me is a "fork" of the original Ethereum DAO philosophy/code/mechanisms.

However, what makes this "fork" unique, is the steadfast focus towards introducing social/cultural standards within the core autonomous, organizing mechanisms. Additionally, the "Daoism" interface (due to complexity was skipped in v1.0.0) will be added to the DAO(distributed autonomous organization) object, for a holistic merging of all that is DAO. To have the Yin, without the Yang, or the Yang without the Yin is not the way of the DAO.

To specify, most "forking" happens via a codebase. DAOYou is focused on forking the IRL social/cultural mechanisms distilled within the first DAO iterations.

***The result being codified/implicit/implied governance via bytes, things and people.***

Yes, the DAOYou will of course start with the existing codified/byte mechanisms (voting mechanisms, ownership, payments, etc...) git branch. However, the primary objectives is to ```git merge``` the implicit/implied mechanisms of the things/people branch into a single unified DAOYou.Me universe branch. 
### What
Current iterations of the DAO, in living form, for one reason or another, can be argued as "an idea ahead of its time". The technological capabilities have surpassed the current cultural mechanisms: CryptoInfrastructure != CulturalValues

#### How

Blockchain technology, (specifically turing-complete blockchains) provide the mechanisms required for nuanced world state management. Relationships existing across time/space, often unable to be analyzed, optimized and evolved, can now be "captured" within an immutable/shared representation of the state as it was/is. However, as posed in the opening statements, the limiting factor to Blockchain/DAO scalability, while at the moment might be technical, the long-term limits are ultimately dictated by the implicit/implied (things/peple) mechanisms comprosing the economic/social infrastructures.

### Why 
Technology is a mechanism, but what matters ***is the people.***

## Historical Analysis
Several people(s) have been responsible for "birthing" a *distributed autonomous organization* on turing-complete blockchain networks. The results of which, depending on who you ask was either "Fantastic!", "Disasterous..." or "Enlightening?". The original Ethereum DAO demonstrated global connectedness by raising $200,000,000 USD<=>Eth, while at the same time exposing a very expensive bug within the Solidity Smart Contract code. Following the original, several other DAOs have been birthed via the Ethereum ***blockchain, turing-complete, smart contracts*** infrastructure.

A DAO(distributed autonomous organization) in the purest form (unencumbered) is a ownerless, borderless, stateless, yet living Entity, which lives/dies from the "actions" of the "people" for which it is comprised.

A DAO(distributed autonomous organization) in the current form (time/space) is an intricate, mechanized, semi-centralized set of coded rules, loosely dictating interaction between people with no previous relationships.

The existing DAO's have been succesful in a number of ways. Foremost, was the demonstration of cryptography at scale. The unique capabilities, and ultimately the value propositions for cryptography is not easily identifiable by most.

- Prime Numbers?
- Public/Private Keys? 
- Zero Knowledge Proof?

What does any of that have to do with a DAO (*distributed autonomous organization*) you ask?

Everything. And nothing. Is the answer.

## The Complicated Breakdown

DAOYou.Me is a model for sustainable life.

## Tokenizing Time/Space As The Great Equalizer

Time. Equal amongst all DAO participants.

Space. Renewed each DAO season/harvest.

Automation will arrive. The current system is incapable of "composting/renewing" economic and social value equal to the pace of production. Therefore, a new economic/social system, capable of capturing universal value is required.

DAOYou.Me is that system.

Humans => Permaculture => Blockchain

Everything Is Connected

Every human (as far as we know) is able to contribute an equal amount of time.

Earth follows (for the time being) a cyclical pattern for renewed energy and space.

Automation and artificial intelligence (if we make it that far) will decouple human time and universal space as the primary mechanism for conscious energy transformation.

The question remaining is "How do we quantify human value?"

The question "How do we quantify human value?" is the underlying motif, woven across the DAOYou.Me philosophy, infrastructure and culture. It's perhaps the single most important question for the 21st Century.

Economic/Social - Principals

The underlying economic/social principals of DAOYou.Me is rooted in renewable natural resources.

Blockchain/Cultural - Mechanisms

The infrastructure mechanisms will be facilitated equally between blockchain smart contracts and shared cultural practices.
