# DAOYou.Me

DAOYou.Me is a model for sustainable life.

## Time/Space - Value
*Time.* Equal amongst all DAO participants.
*Space.* Renewed each DAO season/harvest.

Automation will arrive. The current system is incapable of "composting/renewing" economic and social value equal to the pace of production. Therefore, a new economic/social system, capable of capturing universal value is required.

DAOYou.Me is that system.

Humans => Permaculture => Blockchain

#### Everything Is Connected
Every human (as far as we know) is able to contribute an equal amount of time.

Earth follows (for the time being) a cyclical pattern for renewed energy and space.

Automation and artificial intelligence (if we make it that far) will decouple human time and universal space as the primary mechanism for conscious energy transformation.

The question remaining is ***"How do we quantify human value?"***

The question *"How do we quantify human value?"* is the underlying motif, woven across the DAOYou.Me philosophy, infrastructure and culture. It's perhaps the single most important question for the 21st Century.


## Economic/Social - Principals

The underlying economic/social principals of DAOYou.Me is rooted in renewable natural resources.

## Blockchain/Cultural - Mechanisms
The infrastructure mechanisms will be facilitated equally between blockchain smart contracts and shared cultural practices.

# The Simple Breakdown
The DAOYou.Me is a "fork" of the original Ethereum DAO concept.

However, what makes this "fork" unique, is the steadfast focus towards introducing shared social/cultural standards into the core autonomous, organizing mechanisms. To specify, most "forking" happens with a codebase. Yes, the DAOYou will fork existing code infraustructure (voting mechanisms, ownership, payments, etc...). However, the primary, arguably more important focus, for the long-term viabaility of distributed autonomous organization, will be enforcing the social/cultural mechanisms, which facilitate a thriving DAO.

Simply put, technology is great, in fact neccesary, but at the end of the day... what matters... is the people.
